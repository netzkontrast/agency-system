# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Ingestion and QA Generation feature enables users to upload textual content into the Koh√§renz Protokoll system, automatically process it into structured knowledge units, and generate question-answer pairs for semantic search and retrieval. This feature forms the foundation of the knowledge processing pipeline, transforming raw content into searchable, queryable knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content author, I want to ingest textual content into the system, so that it can be processed and made available for semantic search and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits content via the `/api/ingest` endpoint THEN the system SHALL accept text content with optional metadata
2. WHEN content is received THEN the system SHALL validate the content format and metadata structure
3. WHEN content validation passes THEN the system SHALL parse the content into semantic spans
4. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL store the content in both Qdrant vector database and Postgres relational database
5. IF content ingestion fails THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content author, I want the system to automatically generate questions and answers from my content, so that users can query the knowledge effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content spans are created THEN the system SHALL generate a maximum of 3 atomic questions per span
2. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL create short, medium, and long answers for each question
3. WHEN answers are created THEN the system SHALL ensure every medium answer contains at least 1 citation
4. WHEN QA pairs are complete THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings for semantic search
5. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store QA pairs with their embeddings in the appropriate collections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ingestion process to be idempotent and fault-tolerant, so that the system can handle failures gracefully and avoid duplicate processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same content is ingested multiple times THEN the system SHALL detect duplicates and avoid reprocessing
2. WHEN a processing step fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation according to configured retry policies
3. WHEN all retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL log the failure and maintain system stability
4. WHEN processing is interrupted THEN the system SHALL be able to resume from the last successful step
5. IF content metadata includes chapter/beat information THEN the system SHALL enforce spoiler gate restrictions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content author, I want to track the progress of content ingestion, so that I can monitor the processing status and identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content ingestion starts THEN the system SHALL provide a unique job identifier
2. WHEN processing progresses THEN the system SHALL update the job status in real-time
3. WHEN ingestion completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return processing statistics including content length and generated QA count
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information with context
5. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ingestion workflow to be modular and extensible, so that new processing steps can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new processing nodes are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them into the PocketFlow workflow without breaking existing steps
2. WHEN workflow configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate the new configuration before applying it
3. WHEN processing steps are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data
4. WHEN utility functions are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure all dependent nodes continue to function correctly
5. IF custom processing logic is needed THEN the system SHALL support plugin-style extensions
