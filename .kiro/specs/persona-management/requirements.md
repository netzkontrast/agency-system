# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Persona Management feature allows users to create, manage, and utilize different personas within the Koh√§renz Protokoll system. Personas represent distinct perspectives, domains of expertise, or contextual lenses through which content can be viewed and queried, enabling personalized and contextualized knowledge retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage personas, so that I can organize knowledge from different perspectives and contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a persona via `/api/persona` THEN the system SHALL accept a name and description
2. WHEN a persona is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique persona ID and thoughts namespace
3. WHEN persona information is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the name uniqueness and description format
4. WHEN persona creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the complete persona object with generated fields
5. IF persona creation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to retrieve and list all my personas, so that I can select the appropriate persona for my current task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests personas via `GET /api/persona` THEN the system SHALL return all available personas
2. WHEN personas are listed THEN the system SHALL include ID, name, description, and thoughts namespace for each
3. WHEN no personas exist THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN personas are returned THEN the system SHALL order them by creation date or name alphabetically
5. IF persona retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to update and delete personas, so that I can maintain accurate and relevant persona information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates a persona THEN the system SHALL allow modification of name and description fields
2. WHEN persona updates are made THEN the system SHALL preserve the persona ID and thoughts namespace
3. WHEN a persona is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove the persona and all associated thought data
4. WHEN persona deletion occurs THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and provide deletion status
5. IF persona modification affects existing queries THEN the system SHALL handle the changes gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want personas to have isolated thought spaces, so that knowledge and context remain properly separated between different personas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a persona is created THEN the system SHALL establish a unique thoughts namespace in the vector database
2. WHEN content is associated with a persona THEN the system SHALL store it within the persona's namespace
3. WHEN queries use a persona THEN the system SHALL search only within that persona's thought space
4. WHEN persona thoughts are accessed THEN the system SHALL prevent cross-contamination between personas
5. IF persona namespaces conflict THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts automatically with unique identifiers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persona data to integrate seamlessly with the existing query and ingestion systems, so that personas enhance rather than complicate the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN personas are used in queries THEN the system SHALL integrate persona filtering transparently
2. WHEN content is ingested THEN the system SHALL support optional persona association
3. WHEN persona-specific content is processed THEN the system SHALL follow the same QA generation workflow
4. WHEN persona data is stored THEN the system SHALL use the same reliability and consistency guarantees
5. IF persona features are disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function with global knowledge access
