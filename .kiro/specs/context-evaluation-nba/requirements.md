# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Context Evaluation and NBA (Next Best Action) Generation feature provides intelligent assessment of content context and generates actionable recommendations for users. This feature leverages LLM-as-judge capabilities to evaluate content quality, relevance, and completeness, while suggesting specific actions users can take to improve their knowledge exploration experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to evaluate the context and quality of information, so that I can understand the reliability and completeness of the knowledge I'm accessing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context is submitted via `/api/judge/context` THEN the system SHALL analyze the content for quality indicators
2. WHEN context evaluation occurs THEN the system SHALL assess completeness, accuracy, and relevance metrics
3. WHEN quality assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide structured feedback on content strengths and weaknesses
4. WHEN evaluation criteria are specified THEN the system SHALL apply custom evaluation parameters
5. IF context is insufficient for evaluation THEN the system SHALL indicate what additional information is needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive Next Best Action recommendations, so that I can take meaningful steps to improve my knowledge exploration and content understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate relevant NBA recommendations
2. WHEN NBAs are created THEN the system SHALL include action labels, descriptions, and specific steps
3. WHEN multiple actions are possible THEN the system SHALL prioritize recommendations by impact and feasibility
4. WHEN NBAs are presented THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable instructions for each recommendation
5. IF no meaningful actions are available THEN the system SHALL indicate that the current context is sufficient

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want NBA actions to be contextually relevant and personalized, so that the recommendations align with my current goals and knowledge state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NBAs are generated THEN the system SHALL consider the user's current context and query history
2. WHEN persona information is available THEN the system SHALL tailor recommendations to the persona's perspective
3. WHEN content gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest specific queries or content to explore
4. WHEN learning opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL recommend deeper exploration paths
5. IF user preferences are known THEN the system SHALL align recommendations with preferred learning styles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want context evaluation to be consistent and reliable, so that users receive dependable quality assessments across different content types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar contexts are evaluated THEN the system SHALL provide consistent quality assessments
2. WHEN evaluation criteria change THEN the system SHALL apply updates uniformly across all evaluations
3. WHEN evaluation models are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing assessments
4. WHEN evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback assessments or clear error messaging
5. IF evaluation takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide partial results with completion status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the evaluation system to be extensible and configurable, so that new evaluation criteria and NBA types can be added as the system evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new evaluation criteria are defined THEN the system SHALL integrate them into the assessment workflow
2. WHEN custom NBA templates are created THEN the system SHALL support their generation and presentation
3. WHEN evaluation logic is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain API compatibility for existing integrations
4. WHEN evaluation results are stored THEN the system SHALL support historical analysis and trend identification
5. IF specialized evaluation models are needed THEN the system SHALL support pluggable evaluation engines
