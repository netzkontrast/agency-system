# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Semantic Query System enables users to ask natural language questions and receive relevant answers with citations from the ingested knowledge base. This feature leverages vector similarity search, tag expansion, and persona-based filtering to provide accurate, contextual responses with proper attribution to source materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask natural language questions about the content, so that I can quickly find relevant information without manual searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question via `/api/query` THEN the system SHALL accept natural language text as input
2. WHEN a question is received THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings for semantic matching
3. WHEN embeddings are created THEN the system SHALL perform similarity search across the knowledge base
4. WHEN similar content is found THEN the system SHALL return ranked answers with relevance scores
5. IF no relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate "no results" message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive answers with proper citations, so that I can verify the information and explore the original sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN answers are returned THEN the system SHALL include citations for all medium and long answers
2. WHEN citations are provided THEN the system SHALL include the source span ID and content excerpt
3. WHEN multiple sources contribute to an answer THEN the system SHALL list all relevant citations
4. WHEN citation content is displayed THEN the system SHALL preserve the original formatting and context
5. IF citation sources are restricted by spoiler gates THEN the system SHALL respect access limitations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use personas to filter and contextualize my queries, so that I can get answers tailored to specific perspectives or domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a persona ID is provided with a query THEN the system SHALL filter results based on persona-specific knowledge
2. WHEN persona filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL search within the persona's thought namespace
3. WHEN no persona is specified THEN the system SHALL search across all available content
4. WHEN persona-specific content is found THEN the system SHALL prioritize it in the results
5. IF a persona has no relevant content THEN the system SHALL fall back to general knowledge base search

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to expand my queries with related tags, so that I can discover relevant content even when my question doesn't use exact terminology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is processed THEN the system SHALL identify relevant tags from the question content
2. WHEN tags are identified THEN the system SHALL expand the search to include related tagged content
3. WHEN tag expansion occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain relevance ranking across expanded results
4. WHEN expanded results are returned THEN the system SHALL indicate which results came from tag expansion
5. IF tag expansion produces too many results THEN the system SHALL limit results to the most relevant matches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want query performance to be optimized and scalable, so that the system can handle multiple concurrent users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple queries are submitted simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently without degradation
2. WHEN vector searches are performed THEN the system SHALL complete within acceptable response time limits
3. WHEN query load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance through caching strategies
4. WHEN frequently asked questions are identified THEN the system SHALL cache results for faster retrieval
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement query queuing and rate limiting
